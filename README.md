# format

This library has the goal to bring the Common Lisp format directive to Go. This is work-in-progress, see the summary implementation table below for an overview on what is working and what not.

For a nice introduction to the Common Lisp format see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format_(Common_Lisp).

## Example Code

```go
import "github.com/ragnaroek/format/pkg"

ft.Sformat("~8r", 8) //returns "10"
ft.Sformat("~10,'#,'ü•≠,2:@X", 4099) //returns "####+10ü•≠03"

ft.Sformat("~r", 4343637058903381868) //returns "four quintillion three hundred forty-three quadrillion six hundred thirty-seven trillion fifty-eight billion nine hundred three million three hundred eighty-one thousand eight hundred sixty-eight"
ft.Sformat("~:@r", 2799) //returns "MMDCCLXXXXVIIII"
ft.Sformat("~@r", 2799) //returns "MMDCCXCIX"
```

## Playground

Since the format directives can get complicated and the best way to figure them output is to play around with them the `format` playground was created:

The playground is hosted here: https://ragnaroek.github.io/format/
The library is compiled to WASM to make it run on the browser.

## Implementation Status

The directives listed below are already implemented:

|~ |Name     |Prefix args       |:       |@        |:@        |Note                  |

This table is derived from https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/articles/common-lisp-format-reference/clhs-summary/#subsections-summary-table, which was also a great help in the implementation of the directives so far. Many thanks to Jean-Philippe Paradis.

All other directives not mentioned in the table are not implemented yet.

## Current work-in-progress

Implementing more directives.

Optimisation! `format` is currently ~25% times slower than `fmt`:
```
BenchmarkFmtSimple-12       	18712560	        63.4 ns/op
BenchmarkFmtLong-12         	 4741552	       263 ns/op
BenchmarkFormatSimple-12    	14139633	        81.1 ns/op
BenchmarkFormatLong-12      	 3741561	       318 ns/op
```

You can run the benchmarks yourself with `make bench`.
